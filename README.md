# DupPredictor - 22

This repo details our implementation of the paper titled “Multi-Factor Duplicate Question Detection in Stack Overflow” by Y. Zhang et al. The objective is to create and train a model that is able to take a new question from a user as an input, compute certain weighted measures and give a list of k questions that are most similar to the input question.
